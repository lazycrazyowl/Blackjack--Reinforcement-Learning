# Blackjack--Reinforcement-Learning

Teaching a bot how to play Blackjack using two techniques: Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning.

The game used is OpenAI's gym environment. However, the blackjack game only consists of hitting and standing.

To fully obtain a working Blackjack bot, it would be necessary to add doubling down, splitting, and variation of bets to the game environment.

TODO
1. Complete Double Down Implementation
2. Complete Splitting Implentation
3. Complete Varying Bet Implementation
4. Understand by Q-Learner isn't learning doubling down.
5. Understand why DQN isn't learning well.
